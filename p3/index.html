    The Physics of CSS
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    CSS is essentially mapping HTML elements to rectangular boxes that can be
    positioned on the x-, y- and z-axis.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There is a single place these HTML elements usually live in: the normal
    flow. Elements in the normal flow are born as inline, block elements, or
    not displayed. Not displayed elements are those like meta tags or style
    tags which aren’t visually rendered by the browser. However, HTML elements
    can also be born outside of the normal flow, and interact with the normal
    flow in their own way: like floats, relative elements, and fixed elements.
    Let’s take a look at inline and block elements.
</p>
<h3>
    Inline vs. Block
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    Every HTML element has three different states: Block, Inline or not
    displayed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A block level element will naturally span the entire available width,
    without concern about how much horizontal space it actually needs. As a
    result of that, a block level element will automatically push following
    content to a new line, so by default, two block level elements can't stand
    next to each other - the first will push the second one to the next line
    (floating elements will allow this though, but more on that later).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    However, an inline element does not break the current flow. An inline
    element only takes up the space it needs to render its content and after
    that, more inline elements can be displayed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A good way to remember the difference is to think of an inline element as a
    line of text/sentence and a block level element as a paragraph - the
    sentence can stand together with other sentences to form an entire
    paragraph, but the paragraph breaks the natural flow to create space around
    it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ic0_t6-hwLeU7qPLkYHy5sXOj-6XI8oSxt2cc5alpd1JalPfaYPt7T6Q9EkjAJUmrht4QKkhjU1_VE_1ML38JMS22gTSgPgpZ2UShN8XuRKbDxQjyTJFxq9i9ENPR5Fije3xHja1"
        width="624"
        height="83"
    />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    An example of inline elements include span tags (the generic inline
    element), links (anchors), images and form fields like input. Common block
    level elements include div tags (the generic block level element), header
    tags (h1-h6), paragraphs, lists and tables.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Another important fact is that width and height properties are ignored for
    inline elements. Instead, you can use the line-height property to make an
    inline element smaller or bigger, as the space between each line grows or
    shrinks.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You will also see margins and paddings acting differently than you might be
    used to, when applied to inline elements. In general, if you need to create
    space between or inside elements, you may want to use a block level element
    instead. If you're trying to use inline elements because you want two or
    more elements to stand next to each other, then a floating block level
    element might be more suitable.
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Outline vs. Borders
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    While most HTML elements don't have a border by default, CSS does support
    the feature, with a range of border related properties.
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Border color
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    As per usual.
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Border width
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    The width can be either an absolute value, a relative value, or one of the
    pre-defined border width values: Thin, medium or thick. If you use the
    pre-defined values, it's up to the browser to interpret them, which
    basically gives you less control of how your work will look across all the
    different devices and browsers.
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Border style
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    For style, you have a range of options. The most commonly used is the solid
    border, but there are many more to choose from: hidden, dotted, dashed,
    solid, double, groove, ridge, inset and outset.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img

        width="624"
        height="152"
    />
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Border radius
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    The ability to define border radius was added in CSS3, providing the
    possibility to make rounded corners. In terms of syntax, they’re four slots
    but the first one begins with the top-left and goes around clockwise. Like
    other properties, you can simplify the four slots to two slots or even one.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/B6hsSXp6N-zE7slaXznjDBGQITDOXXnPZ1kl956Qi5B3HQUTaaWPZ4OJ6KzdwpkKfGUsHrLAj0pe0xwgyyqS6bOaTqnZl6aDZ0eCTjYXFxnR6GZc6gPeJHEqxE0X0Bv3I4y0I5Tn"
        width="624"
        height="101"
    />
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Difference Between Borders and Outlines
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    They look identical, however, they are a few key differences. You cannot
    apply a different outline width, style and color for the four sides of an
    element, like you can with the border - the values provided will be used
    for all four sides of the element.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In addition, the outline is not a part of the element's dimensions, like
    the border is, meaning that no matter how thick an outline you apply to the
    element, the dimensions of it won't change. This also means that the
    browser won't reserve the required space for your outline - you will need
    to make sure that it can fit it, without overlapping other elements.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Thus, it is not a feature that’s commonly used, however, it does have one
    unique feature that may come in handy.
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Outline offset
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    A cool thing about outlines is that you can create a distance between it
    and the border, if you want to, by using the outline-offset property. It
    takes a CSS length unit and the empty space between the border (if there is
    any) and the outline will be transparent and thereby take the background
    color of the parent element. Here's an example:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    However, the support for this property is currently a bit limited. As of
    writing, it is for instance not supported by any version of Internet
    Explorer, but support will likely be added in an upcoming version.
    <br>

        width="624"
        height="109"
    />
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Visibility vs. Display
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    CSS has two properties used to control visibility: The visibility property
    and the display property. They are used in different situations and act
    differently in several ways.
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Visibility
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    The initial value of the visibility property is visible, simply meaning
    that the element is visible unless you change it - that makes sense. Now
    try out this example:
    <img
        src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NcdlkBqJAKSIxQoszbyTQU5bE7yYlwjy_DcWKCsXjkpioIZ5-PzJkG3IRvCYcAO2enSS2Xg2YMix6QblJ-xCN6E3CDQjoEm0a-HIvdYQej41fDP9fa1k3wmxEfZqzoZtc_auodVk"
        width="624"
        height="281"
    />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Three boxes but the middle one has been made invisible by setting the
    visibility property to hidden. If you try the example, you will notice one
    very important thing: While the second box is not there, it does leave a
    pretty big hole in the page. Or in other words: The element can't be seen,
    but the browser still reserves the space for it!
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This is one of the most important differences between the visibility
    property and the display property - elements hidden with the visibility
    property still affects layout as if it was visible, sort of like a
    completely transparent element, while elements hidden by the display
    property don't (the browser will treat it as if it wasn't there).
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Display
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    Instead of the visibility property, let’s use the display property this
    time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dO1hC5rHzEboMpFbfEcML0wAcV5VI6nD2Ts9n57m0toucYUubnggGZ63_EXL4yuSbDxMmhahIuJxI6oOpkNCcGKea8Blq3313z-jGqD9ujrG1g5L1fstnq3-hwQ1t3QgaaiLBRPa"
        width="624"
        height="157"
    />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The second box has vanished without a trace, when we used the none value
    for the display property.
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Margins vs. Padding
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oAX19KX1YSuMWNZZNQb5hdlWeej_tw5ZbvwMM1WVpYVKDdBTnIXlKz5xNWdk0U_KSEZsOAasLnpjjbtjf11qsPaLdqbr-NkINSnetoRYNXIPCvtF8c-0TJUoetygU0H09KM4-X-6"
        width="275"
        height="154"
    />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Margins are used to ensure an element has a certain amount of space
    separating it from other elements. Think about it like an outer, invisible
    border. The margins of two elements can “overlap,” but in the case that it
    happens, the distance between them will be the greatest of each’s margin.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The default value for the margin properties is auto, which usually means no
    margin. Some elements, such as headers, body tags and paragraphs may have
    margins added by the browser. This, of course, can be overridden by setting
    margins to zero.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You can also have relative and negative margins. Using a combination of
    negative and positive values for the margin property is a common strategy
    to adjust the position and compensate for the padding in the parent
    element.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Padding is similar to margins, but on the inside of the element. In other
    words, padding is an inner, invisible border around your element.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    By default, most block level elements have zero padding, meaning that text
    and other content will go all the way to the edge of the parent element, as
    seen below.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l7dciNPArl_WRtYl4UQWeNOHTuGZ6R8EKLrRZxB570fXyIdV5x_mH_wRgYD4gyhPwGlr22LMQqpf4NN0GivJNvQ3uJ5KLvAe9aJQwU2vbXG7LuOVsi76VlpTrWzP9c7lzkEr09dY"
        width="624"
        height="96"
    />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    However, with a little bit of padding
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DwnNPP8Az2TkDHwFgpCwCcvzr8Q3gELVUlnB6gvDicuNJbLTHX71hXZqYX8PPf5uoNpieniuCa_sipsYah4O4sL6pK36Mb4ZDoS35q-X7KeKgXosYFL26PB6883cqMmbxThnqWlH"
        width="624"
        height="119"
    />
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Positioning
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    While HTML elements have properties, they also need to be positioned.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    By default, elements are laid out with static positioning. This means
    elements are placed from top to bottom, with specified margins on the
    element and elements around it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Relative positioning places an object relative to its default static
    position by using top, bottom, left, and right properties. Content around
    relatively positioned elements will not adjust to gaps or overlap created.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Fixed positioning positions an element relative to the browser window, and
    does not leave a gap in the normal flow of a page. Fixed elements are also
    placed using the top, bottom, left and right properties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Absolute positioning places an element relative to the entire webpage, or
    within the confines of a non-static ancestor if one exists. Absolute
    positioning uses the same top, bottom, left and right properties.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lastly, sticky positioning allows an object to transition from relative
    positioning to fixed positioning based on a user scrolling through a
    webpage. At least one offset must be specified for sticky positioning to
    work.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <img
        src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YCZVrmdSxaVq6owBh1xrtfYpybTRl69sus7iHdTi0WekNKQvXsh23RsrWput9-CBktrKlj_w-Lmi_fJ8zGTBmVdlARz4jVPDbX3uFNsYUaHCNMe7a6hPf0Q6a1Xwx03Rj2y4ZsUB"
        width="624"
        height="281"
    />
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Syntax
</h3>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Defining Properties
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    Syntax has been mentioned a few times, so let’s recap. When defining
    specific properties, for most of them, HTML provides up to four slots of
    information, starting with top and going around clockwise. For example,
    border-style: border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style and
    border-left-style.
    <img
        src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ObIILPcge-ZttKvRGYggrMM5vPaL79uke1Z-5Nyaq0XA52eAn3_KN_7EmB78TCKdoN34L8hGKoQOmZUUj7G-bUDzkNYbQEQlzqseUjoS1icdoOByHhZCkFwWtapOp5tS9ntjPEa0"
        width="624"
        height="111"
    />
    This pattern of top, right, bottom, and left is consistent with other
    properties, where each slot affects a side of the block element. However,
    much of the time, programmers use two slots or a single slot. In the case
    of a single slot, the browser interprets it such that the single slot is
    applied to all four sides.
</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">
    Units
</h5>
<p dir="ltr">
    When defining properties, units also matter. There are three types:
    absolute, relative, and viewport.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The most common absolute unit are pixels, or px. However, a sometimes handy
    unit is em. Em refers to the size of the font of the most inner wrapping
    element, meaning it grows as the font grows.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The only relative unit is %. It takes a percentage of its parent element.
    However, it can be tricky sometimes, as the % may refer to different a
    different parent element than you have thought,
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lastly, viewport units. While relative units are responsive, viewport units
    are more responsive in the sense that their value changes every time the
    browser resizes. They’re two common ones: Viewport Height (vh, based on the
    height of the viewport) and Viewport Width (vw, based on the width of the
    viewport)
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Selectors
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    You can select elements by id (unique identifiers) with a hash, class
    (identifiers for multiple elements) preceded by a period, or type of
    element.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    #id
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    .class
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    type
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Combining selectors without a space selects elements satisfying all
    combined selectors
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Combining selectors with a space selects elements satisfying the later
    selector descended from the first selector
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Separating selectors with commas selects elements satisfying any of the
    combined selectors.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There are more uncommon selector syntaxes, such as “element&gt;element”
    (which denotes a parent and their child), “element+element” (which denotes
    the later element placed immediately after the former), and
    “element~element” (which denotes the later element preceded by the former).
